DESCRIPTION					   *BufferPersist-description*

This plugin automatically persists (parts of) certain buffers when Vim is done
editing the buffer, regardless of whether is was saved to a file or discarded.
In this way, this is related to the built-in |persistent-undo| functionality,
but rather meant for building a history of file contents to allow browsing and
recall, especially for things like commit messages, where Vim is invoked as
the editor from an external tool.

SEE ALSO								     *

This plugin is used by:
MessageRecall (vimscript #4116): Browse and re-insert previous (commit,
				 status) messages.

USAGE							 *BufferPersist-usage*

The plugin is completely inactive until you set it up for a particular
buffer through the following function; you'll find the details directly in the
.vim/autoload/BufferPersist.vim implementation file.

BufferPersist#Setup( BufferStoreFuncref, ... )


EXAMPLE						       *BufferPersist-example*

Let's store the first three lines of each edited text file in the temp
directory, using the text file's filename prefixed with "preview-": >
    function! BufferStore( bufNr )
	return $TEMP . '/preview-' . fnamemodify(bufname(a:bufNr), ':t')
    endfunction
    autocmd BufNew,BufRead *.txt call BufferPersist#Setup(
    \	function('BufferStore'),
    \	{'range': '1,3'}
    \)

INSTALLATION					  *BufferPersist-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-BufferPersist
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim BufferPersist*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					  *BufferPersist-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.044 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					   *BufferPersist-limitations*

KNOWN PROBLEMS					*BufferPersist-known-problems*

TODO							  *BufferPersist-todo*

- Add option to skip persisting when never modified in Vim or equal to the
  previous stored buffer persistence (which would need to be passed in).

HISTORY						       *BufferPersist-history*

1.10	RELEASEME
- ENH: Offer definition of a buffer-local command to persist the current
  buffer state on demand, via a:options.writeCommandName.
- Minor: Make substitute() robust against 'ignorecase'.
- Don't clobber the search history with the a:options.range (if given and
  using a /{pattern}/ address).
- Add dependency to ingo-library (vimscript #4433). *** You need to separately
  install ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.044 (or higher)! ***
